(light background music. A recruiter scrolls through a portfolio website on a laptop. The aspirant stands beside, trying to smile. The recruiter makes a quick face, closes the laptop, and says “Thanks, we’ll get back to you.” Then walks off.)

Narrator :
You know what? It’s not just your skills and experience that matter anymore...

(Narrator steps into frame, looks directly at the camera.)

Narrator :
…it’s how you show them.

(aspirant, looking confused.)

Aspirant:
What do you mean? I’ve got solid projects and work experience.

(Narrator walks over casually)

Narrator :
Yeah, but first impressions matter.
If your portfolio looks basic or outdated, most recruiters won’t even scroll past the home page.

(Zoom in on the laptop: it’s a dull, static website — no color, no animation, plain layout.)

Narrator:
See this? It’s not bad, but it’s not gonna grab attention either.

(Aspirant is frustated)

Aspirant:
Ugh… I have no idea how to fix this. I don’t even know who to talk to.

(narrator chuckles)

Narrator :
Relax. I know someone who’s got you covered.
Parth — a full-stack developer who builds modern, sleek, and responsive portfolios. Smooth animations, clean layouts — the kind that actually get noticed.

(Cut to clips of modern portfolio websites: scrolling animations, color themes, mobile-friendly layouts.)

Aspirant :
Okay, but what if I want something more personal? Like my own colors or layout?

Narrator :
Yup, fully custom. You pick the style — dark mode, minimal, bold colors — he’ll build it your way.
And if you’re not happy? He offers up to 5 free revisions till you’re 100% satisfied.

(Aspirant looks satisfied)

Aspirant :
Okay yeah… this guy sounds legit.

(narrator turns to look at camera)

Narrator :
So if your portfolio isn’t doing justice to your talent — hit up Parth. Let your work stand out.

[On-screen text: “DM @parth.now on Instagram” — clean, bold animation with IG icon.]

Narrator :
Reach out now — and get a portfolio that actually works for you.

(Final shot: recruiter revisits the new portfolio, looks impressed, nods, and smiles.)
